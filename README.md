# What is this?

It's a basic fake website that emulates a LinkedIn profile page.

## Why?

In order to learn and master CSS, I built this website.

## Sounds Cool, did you learn anything?

Yup! I just wanted to try and see if I could recreate the wireframe and add in some basic flairs with just pure HTML and CSS.

## Recent Updates
This project now has some basic Javascript functionality that re-renders certain parts of the 
page depending on what the user interacts with!
Accepting a friend request will update the counter of the connections list as well as removing that particular request from the requests list.
